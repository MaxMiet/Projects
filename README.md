Python folder - small python projects I've made to learn python.

Sleepify - I coded this program to shut off Spotify music playback after a selected time period, as I liked to fall asleep to music but would not want it to play all night.
Unity Game Scripts - This folder contains some of the scripts that belong to a small Unity based game project I made while on a Unity basics course in uni.
game_lua_scripts - This folder contains a few game client automation bot related scripts.\n
