Hi, Iâ€™m Max.
I've been interested in computer science since I was 12, found myself dabbling in code at a young age, at the time I ofcourse did not understand it
but I had a burning passion to try to start understanding it.
so over time I developed skills to research and find information online that I needed to help me learn and understand anything I needed, anything I found interesting at the time.
ex. coding, reverse engineering, game hacking, game bot scripts, bruteforcing and much more.
These topics interested me in a major way, but I could not pursue any of these interests fully, until recently.

Currently working on improving myself and moving forward with my self-teaching journey.
So far python is definitely my favorite language I've dabbled in, currently diving deeper into python through self teaching, working on getting better and always learning more and something new.
Any code you'll find here will probably be newbie-like and messy for now, but over time, with passion comes progress.
Also very interested in cyber security stuff, currently mainly starting out on HackThebox and TryHackMe challenges, working through the basics.
